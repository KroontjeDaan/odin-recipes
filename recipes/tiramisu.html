    <h4>Yummiest tiramisu ever! And very easy to make. This is my family's favorite. One serving is not enough! Believe me! Don't substitute double cream for mascarpone. There is no tiramisu without mascarpone. And use the best-quality coffee.</h4>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ⅛ cups mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>24 ladyfingers</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups brewed coffee</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat yolks, sugar, and vanilla until smooth and light yellow. Fold mascarpone into yolk mixture. Set aside.</li>
